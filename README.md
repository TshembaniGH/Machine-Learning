# Machine-Learning

This repository documents my ongoing journey into the world of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. I began this path in early 2025 with a commitment to never look back, driven by a vision to become an astute data scientist who creates real-world impact through data.

As the AI revolution unfolds, I’m actively exploring every corner of the data landscape, building projects, experimenting with new tools, and continuously learning. I’m not limiting myself; if it involves data, I’m diving in.

My ultimate goal is to develop practical, data-driven solutions that solve real-world problems.
I invite you to follow my journey by exploring the projects shared here.
